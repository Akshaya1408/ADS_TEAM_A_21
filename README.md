MINI PROJECT

ABSTRACT:  
Cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease, remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Timely identification of individuals at risk is crucial for effective prevention and intervention strategies. This project employs a machine learning-based approach to predict the risk of heart disease by analyzing a comprehensive set of patient data. The dataset encompasses diverse factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure and cholesterol. The predictive model is developed using a combination of supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and DecisionTree. These algorithms are applied to identify the accurate risk assessment. The model is trained and validated on a large, representative dataset to ensure robust performance. Furthermore, the project explores the interpretability of the predictive model, shedding light on the key features contributing to risk predictions. This interpretability aspect aims to enhance the transparency of the model and facilitate its integration into clinical decision-making processes. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a reliable and interpretable tool for healthcare professionals to identify individuals at high risk of heart disease, enabling early interventions.
